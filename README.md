<summary>## Introduction<summary>
• Java is a programming language that helps developers build software applications. It follows 
an object-oriented approach, meaning it organizes code into reusable objects.

## Types of Programming Languages
Programming languages can be grouped based on how they're structured:
1. Structured Programming Languages:
    o Examples: C, Python
    o These languages use a logical flow of commands.
2. Object-Based Programming Languages:
    o Examples: Visual Basic (VB), VBScript, Python
    o They support some object-oriented programming (OOP) ideas like classes and objects, but not inheritance.
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages:
    o Examples: C++, Java, C#, Python
    o These languages support all OOP concepts.

##  OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Concepts
1. Class
2. Object
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation

<summary>Basics of Java</summary>
## Java Features
1. Platform Independent: Java can run on any device with Java Runtime Environment (JRE), 
making it versatile.
2. Case Sensitive: Java treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different (e.g., a is not the 
same as A).

## Java Components
1. JDK (Java Development Kit): Tools for developing Java applications.
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Needed to run Java applications.
3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Runs the Java code on your device.

## Core Java vs. Advanced Java
• Core Java: Focuses on the basics (Java SE).
• Advanced Java: Covers more specialized topics (Java EE), like web services and databases.

## Java Versions
• JDK 8: Created by Sun Microsystems, now managed by Oracle.
• Latest Version: JDK 22.
• Recommended Version: JDK 11+ for most uses.
• Java Distributions:
    o Community Edition: Free and open-source (OpenJDK).
    o Licensed Edition: Commercial with long-term support (Oracle JDK).

## JDK Download & Installation (Refer the installation document)
• Download and Install JDK
• Set Java Path inside environment variables
• Verify Installation inside command prompt
Eclipse IDE Download & Installation (Refer the installation document)
• Download Eclipse IDE and install it.
• Launch eclipse and create new java project.

## Setting Up a Java Project in Eclipse
1. Create a New Java Project: File → New → Java Project
2. Create a New Package: Right-click on src → New → Package
3. Create a New Class: Right-click on the package → New → Class

## Java Naming Conventions
1. Start with an uppercase letter (e.g., MyClass).
2. Class names shouldn't begin with numbers.
3. Underscores (_) are allowed in class names.
4. Avoid using special characters.
5. Numbers are allowed but not as the first character.

## Comments in Java
• Single-Line Comment: // This is a comment
• Multi-Line Comment: /* This is a multi-line comment */

## Keyboard Shortcuts
• Auto-Complete System Output: Type Syso then press Ctrl + Space (or CMD + Space on Mac).
• Single-Line Comment: Press Ctrl + /
• Multi-Line Comment: Press Ctrl + Shift + /

<summary>Variables and Keywords</summary>
### Introduction to Variables

A Variable is a name given to a memory location. It is used to store a value that may vary. Java is a statically typed language, and hence, all the variables are declared before use.  

#### Variable Declaration
In Java, we can declare variables as follows:

type: Type of the data that can be stored in this variable. It can be int, float, double, etc.
name: Name given to the variable.
data_type variable_name;

Example: int x;

In this way, we can only create a variable in the memory location. Currently, it doesn’t have any value. We can assign the value in this variable by using two ways:
• By using variable initialization.
• By taking input
Here, we have discussed only the first way, i.e. variable initialization. We will discuss the second way later.

data_type variable_name = value;
Example: int x = 10;

## Java Keywords:
 
Keywords in Java are also known as reserved words. These are the predefined words therefore they can’t be used as a variable name. If we will use keywords as a variable name, the result will be a compile-time error. The list of all the Java Keywords is given below.
